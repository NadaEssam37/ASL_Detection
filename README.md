# ASL_Detection
Knowledge base
This project implements an American Sign Language (ASL) detection system using Python and deep learning techniques. It aims to recognize hand gestures from ASL and classify them into corresponding letters or words. The model is trained on a dataset of hand gesture images representing ASL alphabets. It can be used to build educational tools, accessibility apps for the deaf and hard of hearing, or gesture-controlled interfaces.

Features:

1Image-based ASL letter recognition

2-Deep learning model built with TensorFlow/Kera

3-Real-time prediction support (optional via webcam)

4-Training visualization with accuracy/loss plots

5-Dataset preprocessing and augmentation

6-Supports classification of 26 alphabets (A-Z)

Model Details:

1-Architecture: CNN (e.g., Conv2D + MaxPooling + Dense layers)

2-Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

3-Input shape: 64x64 or 128x128 images (depending on dataset)

4-Output: Softmax layer with 26 classes
